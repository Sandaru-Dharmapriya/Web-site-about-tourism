                <h2>History</h2>
                
                <p>When King Wickramabahu III assumed the throne and established court in Peradeniya, close to the Mahaweli
                    river, the Botanic Gardens first appeared. This was in 1371. Rajadhi Rajasinghe and King Kirti Sri came
                    after that. King Wimala Dharma had a temple built here, but the British, who had taken over rule of
                    the Kandyan Kingdom, demolished it.Then, in 1821, Alexandar Moon laid the foundation for a botanical garden.
                    He cultivated coffee and cinnamon plants in the garden.[4] Plants from Kew Garden, Slave Island, Colombo, and
                    the Kalutara Garden in Kalutara were used to create the Peradeniya Botanical Garden, which was officially 
                    founded in 1843. Greater independence was granted to the Royal Botanic Garden, Peradeniya.

                <p>
                    Built in 1807 by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe near to the Temple of the Tooth, Kandy Lake , also
                    known as Kiri Muhuda or the Sea of Milk, is an artificial lake in the center of the hill city of Kandy, Sri Lanka.
                    Its size was diminished over time. Fishing is prohibited since the lake is protected.

                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>
                    Tigolwela, a section of paddy fields, was once the lake in front of the Temple of the Tooth. King Sri Wickrama
                    Rajasinha transformed it into a lake in 1807. The lake built afterwards was also called Kiri-muhuda since there
                    had previously been a pond with the name Kiri-muhuda in the center of the Tigolwela. Kandy Lake
                    is credited to architect Deveda Moolacharya. The steps leading into the lake by the Mahamaluwa are still
                discernible on the Paththirippuwa (octagon) side, where the monarch initially constructed a dam across the paddy
                fields, extending over to the Poya-maluwa. The dam, on which a road was built, made it possible for the king to
                    cross over to the Malwatte Vihare. To quote D'Oyley,
                </p>

                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>
                    Kandy Lake covers an area of 6,544 square meters. The radius is 3.21 kilometers. 18.5 meters is the maximum depth.
                    The parapet wall, known as Walakulu Bemma, is 633.82 meters long and has the appearance of a cloud. In the past, 
                    the structure at the lake's center, together with several antiquated ruins, was referred to as Diyatilaka Mandapaya.
                    This pavilion is thought to have been utilized by the Kings for leisure.There are places to walk or run around Kandy 
                    Lake. Views of the hills and the town are available from the trail that circles the lake in the shade. Atop a hill 
                    overlooking the lake sits the Malwatte temple, one of the two main temples of the Theravada Buddhist Siyam Nikaya sect.
                </p>

                <h3>Diyathilaka Mandapaya</h3>

                <p>
                    To cross the lake to the other side, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe constructed a dam. The king created an island by removing
                    the dirt from the Malwatte Vihare end and the palace end. Initially, the Queen and the ladies of the court utilized this
                    island as their royal summer residence. Later, the British utilized it as an ammunition storage facility and surrounded 
                    it with a parapet in the appearance of a fortress.
                </p>

                <h3>Walakula Bamma</h3>

                <p>
                    In order to enhance the beauty of the Kandy Lake, a wall known as Walakulu Bamma  or Clouds Wall was constructed around it.
                    It took one talented architect to construct it, and it circles the lake on half of its perimeter. Before the British took
                    control of the city and compelled Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe to cede control of the Kandian kingdom, he was unable to 
                    finish the wall. The Walakulu Bamma is yet incomplete. On festival days, oil lights were once lit in the triangular-
                    shaped holes in the wall.
                </p>

                <h3>Ulpange</h3>

                <p>
                    Part of the Ulpange or Queens Bathing Pavilion is located in Kandy Lake. When taking a bath in the lake, Sri Wickrama
                    Rajasinghe's wives and concubines used the pavilion. Following their occupation of the city, the British constructed 
                    another floor and converted the structure into a library. Currently, it serves as a police station.

                <p>
                    Trees of all kinds, including Nuga trees, palm trees, fruit trees, Sal trees, and Mara trees, have been planted all 
                    around the lake. Around 74 years old are a few of the trees. The Kandy Municipal Council is currently responsible for
                    caring for the trees. The lake is home to a variety of bird species, including pelican, white egret crane, wood stork,
                    and Indian cormorant.
                </p>

                <h3>Pollution</h3>

                <p>
                    The lake's pollution is a severe issue. By erecting signs and running environmental clubs, the government and the nearby
                    schools are attempting to lessen the issue. The lake was used by the Kandy water board to supply water to the neighboring
                    communities up until 1960. The increased pollution caused them to stop pumping water out of the lake.

                    South-west of Kandy in Sri Lanka's central highlands is where you'll find the Hanthana Mountain Range. According to the 
                    National Environment Act, it was designated as an environmental protection area in February 2010. The range's highest point
                    is 1,200 meters (3,800 feet). The mountain range has seven peaks in all. The Uura Kanda is the highest. The range is a 
                    popular location for Sri Lankan mountain walkers. The Hanthana mountain range is located close to the University of 
                    Peradeniya.

                    In Sri Lanka, during the Gampola Era , King Vikramabahu III constructed the Embekka Devalaya (Embekka Temple).
                    The Kataragama deviyo is the focus of the Devalaya. At this location, people also worship Devatha Bandara, a local god.
                    The "Sanctum of Garagha", the "Digge" or "Dancing Hall," and the "Hevisi Mandapaya" or "Drummers' Hall" are the three
                    sections that make up the shrine. Visitors have gravitated toward the Drummers' Hall because of the exquisite wood 
                    carvings[2] on its elaborate pillars and its steeply pitched roof.
                </p>

                <h3>Location</h3>

                <p>
                    In the Kandy District's Medapalata Korale of Udunuwara, Embekke Devalaya is located. In earlier times in Sri Lanka,
                    people would stop here for protection on lengthy trips or pilgrimages. The King Bhuwanekabhahu IV is claimed to have
                    constructed this Ambalama between AD 1341 and 1357.

                    Some of the timber used for the "Drummers' Hall" is reported to have come from a Gampola "Royal Audience Hall" that
                    had been abandoned. The hall may have undergone restorations while the Sinhalese Kings of Kandy were in power. Some 
                    of the best specimens of Sinhalese art can be found on the carvings that grace the wooden pillars of the drummers'
                    hall and the "Vahalkada" (the Devala's entrance porch, which is thought to be older). The wooden pillars have an 
                    octagonal base and a square-shaped "Pekada" at the top made of four leaves. The carvings of interwoven swans, double
                    -headed eagles, entwined rope patterns, nursing mothers, and soldiers fighting on are among the most notable and well
                    -known.
