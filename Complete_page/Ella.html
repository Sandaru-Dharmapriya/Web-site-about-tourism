        the town experiences a colder climate than the lowlands around. Views across Sri Lanka's 
        southern plains are possible from the Ella Gap. Even the light from the lighthouses along the 
        southern coast can be seen on a beautiful morning. Ella has a variety of incredible activities, from scaling lush 
        mountain peaks to leaping into cool waterfalls. After spending the day in the outdoors, visitors can unwind in the 
        town's lively environment at one of the many fantastic cafes and eateries. The top activities to do when visiting

      <h2> Nine Arches Railway Bridge</h2>
        <img src="Ella_Images/Ella2.jpg" alt="Nine Arches Railway Bridge">
      <p>The town is most famous for its iconic nine arches railway bridge which is a fine example of colonial-era 
        construction in Sri Lanka. A trek down the railway track to the bridge is a popular activity, especially around 
        the time the train arrives. There are numerous quaint cafes, walking trails and guest houses nestled in the hills 
        for a peaceful getaway.</p>

      <h2>Little Adam's Peak through bamboo forests</h2>
      <img src="Ella_Images/Ella3.jpg" alt="Little Adam's Peak through bamboo forests">
      <p>Hiking Little Adam’s Peak in Sri Lanka is one of the most epic things to do in Ella. The peak can be hiked easily 
        without a guide, as there is a marked path that leads you up the mountain, with plenty of signposts to show you the 
        way. The peak is not to be confused with Adam’s peak, which is a little way away and a considerably tougher and longer 
        hike. It gets its name from Adam’s peak because this mountain replicates its shape, in a smaller form.</p>

      <h2>Ellawala Falls</h2>
      <img src="Ella_Images/Ella4.jpg" alt="Ellawala Falls">
      <p>The Ella - Wellawaya Road leads to Ellewala Ella, a little but stunning waterfall in the Monaragala District. 
        About 5 miles from Wellawaya Town, this waterfall is tucked away in the woods. To get to the Rathmal Vehera 
        Ancient Temple from Wellawaya, use the Ella Road about 3 kilometres. Take the road that is adjacent to the temple 
        to go to the waterfall. According to reports, the final few kilometres are rugged and unsuitable for vehicles 
        with little ground clearance. You might need a 44 or a 3 wheeler to get around. You must traverse the bush for a 
        few hundred metres in order to reach the fall.</p>

        significant historical tourism destinations. According to legend, King Ravana utilised the Ravana cave to hide 
        Princess Sita. The Ravana Cave must be visited if you have any interest in Sri Lankan history and are willing to 
        walk some stairs to get there. It is unquestionably among the enjoyable things to do in Ella, Sri Lanka. This blog
